- 👋 Hi, I’m @spoooooonman
- 👀 I’m interested in programming (obviously), sports and music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Web Development by myself but I'm currently learning C++ in school. Later I'll do Java, PHP, MySQL and some other stuff
- 💞️ I would love to collaborate to some projects to learn new things.
